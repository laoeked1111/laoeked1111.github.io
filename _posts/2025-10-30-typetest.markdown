## Project Details

### Links

The [Github repo](https://github.com/laoeked1111/typetest) has all the code and instructions for running the test.

### Info

The typetester implements two types of tests: finite and continuous. 
A finite test has a finite number of words that the user specifies and times how long the user takes to type them.
A continuous test asks the user for a test duration, and the user types as many words as possible in the alloted time.
Words per minute (wpm) is defined in the typical standard as the total number of characters typed, divided by 5, and normalized to a total time of 60 seconds.
