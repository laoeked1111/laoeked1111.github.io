## Project Details

The code for the project is available in my [Github repo](https://github.com/laoeked1111/resistor-color-code-calculator). I wanted the calculator to be accessible from the terminal, so I wrote the calculator using the tkinter library. From the color bands, it gives the tolerance, the nominal value, as well as the minimum and maximum possible values given the tolerance.
